9 movement, if no middle then 6.
    Each rotation changes the position
    *use wiki page notation
    Front Back Up Down Left Right, default clockwise, ' counter-clockwise, _2 180 degree.
    F B U D L R

-------------------------
Position is necessary to determine if a layer is changed.
    Each block have a 3d xyz coordinate
    Each block have a position(direction) attribute. Corner have 3, edge have 2, middle block have 1(different if cube have direction instead of color)
    But blocks are connected, so there are few less positions than 3*2 * 8 * 2*2 * 12 * 6 = 13824 possibilities.
    How to represent the relationships?
    If use the 20 depth inference, 3 moves(clock counterclock 180)*9 action-> 3^9=19683 possibility. means any problem could be solved within 19683 moves. though low efficiency.

How to find solution?
    1.knows that the corner block is adjustable without effecting the edge block.
    2.infer that the rule holds for upper layers.

So in our case, we can generate (3*6)*(3*6-1)^(n-1) moves, then check if bottom is the same.<F11>

Jan 12: add Group Theory permutation denotations.
    From Left to Right, (1,2,4)(3)(5)*(3,1)(4,2)=(1,4,3)(2)(5)

    Theorem: The Cube always has even parity. 
    It says that it means that hence there's no move that will exchange a single pair of cubies. 
    
    Thinks: 
        to simplify, consider 2x2. a movement 
        F(2x2) = (FLU, FRU, FRD, FLD)=(FLU, FRU)(FLU, FRD)(FLU, FLD)
        so in 2x2 each movement is odd.
